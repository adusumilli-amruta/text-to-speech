# Text to Speech Converter

This project is a web application that converts text into speech. Users can input text, select a language from a dropdown menu, and convert the text into speech in the selected language. Built using Next.js for the frontend and Transformers.js for the backend, it offers an intuitive interface and supports multiple languages for conversion.

## Introduction

The Text to Speech Converter simplifies the process of converting written text into spoken language. This tool is particularly useful for accessibility purposes, language learning, and any scenario where audio output of text is needed.

## Proposed Ideas

1. **Multilingual Support**: Enable conversion of text to speech in multiple languages.
2. **User-Friendly Interface**: Develop an intuitive interface for easy text input and language selection.
3. **Efficient Processing**: Ensure quick and accurate text-to-speech conversion using advanced NLP models.
4. **Customization Options**: Allow users to adjust speech parameters such as speed and pitch (future enhancement).

## Major Steps

1. **Set Up Next.js Project**: Initialize the Next.js framework for the web application.
2. **Integrate Transformers.js**: Use Transformers.js to handle the text-to-speech conversion.
3. **Develop Frontend Components**: Create input forms, dropdown menus for language selection, and display areas for the output.
4. **Implement Backend Logic**: Handle text processing and language selection, and manage the conversion process.
5. **Testing and Debugging**: Ensure the application works correctly across different browsers and devices.

## Techniques

### NLP Models and Transformers.js

- **Text-to-Speech Models**: Utilizing models like Tacotron2 or WaveNet for high-quality speech synthesis.
- **Language Processing**: Supporting multiple languages by integrating pre-trained models capable of handling diverse linguistic features.
- **API Integration**: Using APIs to fetch and process text and convert it into speech dynamically.

### Frontend Development with Next.js

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Enhancing performance and SEO with SSR capabilities of Next.js.
- **Interactive UI Components**: Building responsive and user-friendly input fields, dropdown menus, and output displays.
- **State Management**: Managing the state of input text, selected language, and conversion results efficiently.

## Evaluations

1. **Quality of Speech**: Assessing the naturalness and clarity of the generated speech.
2. **Language Accuracy**: Ensuring the correct pronunciation and intonation for different languages.
3. **Performance Metrics**: Measuring the application's response time and its ability to handle concurrent requests.
4. **User Feedback**: Collecting feedback from users to improve the interface and functionality.
5. **Error Handling**: Implementing robust error handling to manage issues such as unsupported languages or input errors.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/adusumilli-amruta/text-to-speech.git
   cd text-to-speech
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
