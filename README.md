# Text to Speech Converter


This project is a web application that converts text into speech. Users can enter text in an input box, select a language from a dropdown menu, and click "Convert" to generate speech in the selected language. The application is built using Next.js for the frontend and Transformers.js for the backend processing.

## Introduction

The Text to Speech Converter is designed to convert textual input into spoken words in various languages. This tool is beneficial for accessibility purposes, language learning, and content creation.

## Proposed Ideas

1. **Multilingual Support**: Provide support for multiple languages to cater to a global audience.
2. **Voice Customization**: Allow users to select different voices or accents.
3. **High-Quality Speech Output**: Ensure the synthesized speech is clear and natural-sounding.
4. **User-Friendly Interface**: Develop an intuitive interface for easy text input and language selection.

## Major Steps

1. **Set Up Next.js Project**: Initialize the Next.js framework to build the web application.
2. **Integrate Transformers.js**: Use Transformers.js for the text-to-speech conversion process.
3. **Develop Frontend Components**: Create input forms and dropdown menus for text input and language selection.
4. **Implement Backend Logic**: Handle text processing and speech synthesis, and manage the conversion process.
5. **Testing and Debugging**: Ensure the application works correctly and efficiently through rigorous testing.

## Techniques

### NLP Models and Transformers.js

- **Transformer Models**: Utilizing models like Tacotron2 or WaveNet for speech synthesis.
- **Tokenization and Embeddings**: Converting text into tokens and embeddings suitable for processing by transformer models.
- **Speech Synthesis Pipeline**: Using pre-trained models and fine-tuning them for the specific task of text-to-speech conversion.

### Frontend Development with Next.js

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Enhancing performance and SEO using SSR.
- **Interactive UI Components**: Building responsive and user-friendly components for text input, language selection, and speech output.
- **State Management**: Efficiently managing the state of text input, selected languages, and conversion results.

## Evaluations

1. **Speech Quality**: Assessing the clarity, naturalness, and accuracy of the synthesized speech.
2. **Performance Metrics**: Measuring the application's response time and its ability to handle multiple requests.
3. **User Feedback**: Collecting feedback to improve the interface and functionality.
4. **Error Handling**: Implementing robust error handling to manage issues such as unsupported languages or text inputs.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/adusumilli-amruta/text-to-speech.git
   cd text-to-speech
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the application in your browser:
   ```plaintext
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

2. Enter text in the input field.

3. Select the target language from the dropdown menu.

4. Click the "Convert" button to generate and listen to the synthesized speech.

## Future Research and Upgrades

1. **Voice Cloning**: Research techniques to clone and replicate specific voices.
2. **Emotion and Tone Modulation**: Enhancing speech synthesis to include emotional and tonal variations.
3. **Real-Time Conversion**: Implementing real-time text-to-speech conversion for live applications.
4. **Customizable Voice Profiles**: Allowing users to create and save custom voice profiles for different use cases.
